      <p>Ever since I was a kid I've been curious on a lot of things. How things work, life, why things have to be a certain way, etc. So it was not a shocker when I tried everything in life that my heart desired. My curiousty has lead me to many roads in my life. I went from working to get into law school, to working for a major retailer. Which has led me to where I am today. Jumping into uncharted and unknown territories known as web developlment.</p>

      <p>So here I am exploring, learning and trying my best to remain calm and keep coding.</p>
